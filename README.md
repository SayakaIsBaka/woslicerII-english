# woslicerII English Translation

Translation by Sayaka, with help from w, Dolphin and marie  
Original japanese version by wosderge: https://cerebralmuddystream.nekokan.dyndns.info

- `woslicerII_s_eng.exe` is the regular woslicerII translated in english, with no other modifications
- `woslicerII_s_eng_initmod.exe` is a very slightly modded version of woslicerII that initializes fadeout, offset to 0 and disables cutting volume on startup

The IDA database for the translation is also provided in the repository (`idb` file, also contains patches for `woslicerII_s_eng_initmod.exe`)

**THIS WAS ONLY TESTED ON JAPANESE LOCALE, I HAVE NO IDEA IF IT WORKS ON OTHER LOCALES (it should at least make the text readable but I did not try it)**
